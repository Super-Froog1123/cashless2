                The World Expo 2025, themed ‚ÄúDesigning Future Society for Our Lives,‚Äù is being held in Osaka, Japan.
                This is the first World Expo to go fully cashless, with all payments required to be made digitally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over 70 different cashless payment options are available including credit cards and QR codes payments.
                Expo association assures that most globally used payments brands will be supported, allowing them to use
                the same methods rely on in their daily lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                A Digital Wallet based on blockchain and Web3 technology has been introduced at the Expo to encourage
                and facilitate visitors‚Äô cashless payment.

                ‚ÄúIt is very convenient. We don‚Äôt have to bring cash. We can just bring cards,‚Äù Ayami Kobayashi, a local
                visitor aged 28, said.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yoshida Takeshi, a 70-year-old Japanese visitor who is accustomed to paying by credit card or cash, also
                praised the cashless policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, the policy is less accommodating for those who prefer paying only by cash. Akai Shigeo, a
                74-year-old Japanese visitor, usually pays in cash.
            </p>

            <p>
                ‚ÄúI would rather buy nothing (or) eat nothing. I only consume outside the expo (where) cash is allowed,‚Äù
                Akai said.
            </p>

            <p>
                This push for cashless transactions at one of Japan‚Äôs high-profile events comes as the country gradually
                embraces digital payments. Across Japan, consumers can now choose between various options including
                mobile payments (e.g. PayPay and Wechat Pay), credit cards, and pre-paid integrated circuit (IC) cards
                (e.g. Suica). IC cards, similar to Hong Kong‚Äôs Octopus card, are wildly used on Japan Rail networks and
                shops.

                This low adoption rate is not due to lack of innovation. Sony launched the contactless chip FeliCia in 2000, and the country‚Äôs first mobile wallet, the m-wallet, was introduced by the network provider NTT Docomo in 2004.
            </p>

            <p>
                Japan‚Äôs slow adoption to cashless payment stems from its aging population, small businesses hesitation, and concerns about privacy and frauds.

                Cash-oriented Elderly Citizens
            </h2>

        <section class="section1" id="md1">
            <p>
                In Japan, a growing phenomenon called "Kodokushi," or "lonely death," refers to elderly individuals who die alone and remain undiscovered for days, weeks, or even months. The property left behind by the deceased elderly may be inherited, sold, or abandoned.
            </p>

            <p>
                Terrence Poon, the managing director of Japan Starway Travel Corporation, was born in Hong Kong and has lived in Japan for 40 years.
            </p>

            <p>
                Poon explained that when cleanup crews were hired to clear those elderly‚Äôs properties, they sometimes find stacks of cash - tucked in wardrobes, hidden under floorboards, or stashed in secret compartments- amounting of tens of millions of yen, or even hundreds of millions of yen.
            </p>

            <p>
                ‚ÄúIn Japan, many elderly people strongly resist digital payments,‚Äù Poon added. ‚ÄúWhat if my phone gets lost or breaks? How would I pay for anything? Japanese feel safer with physical cash in their pockets.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
                Naoyuki Yoshino, a Professor Emeritus at Keio University who specializes in fiscal and monetary policy, agreed that elderly are more ‚Äúcash oriented‚Äù. 
            </p>

            <p>
                He explained that many elderly avoid using cards because they struggle to track spending digitally, unlike with cash, where they physically see how much they have left. Checking bank statements feels unfamiliar and inconvenient, discouraging them from adopting cashless methods.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to Statistic Bureau of Japan, Japan has the oldest median age in the world, at 48.6 years. 28.7% of the population are over the age of 65, totally 36.17 million people. There are 80,000 people in the country aged over 100 years old. 
            </p>

            <p>
                ‚ÄúI am old now. It is hard for me to learn e-payment or new technology,‚Äù visitor Akai said.

                ‚ÄúA 3% fee is usually charged for their transactions. At the same time, the cash payment back to each restaurant takes one month or two months, but small restaurants need money today without being charged any fees,‚Äù Yoshino said.

                In 2002, Japan introduced the Basic Resident Register Network, assigning citizens unique 11-digit ID codes containing personal details, such as name, birthdate, and address. The following year, the government issued IC-chip Resident Registration cards linked to these numbers. However, both network and cards faced strong public and political opposition. Despite backlash, the Supreme Court upheld their constitutionality in 2008.

            <p>
                To boost Japan's digital economy, the government introduced 12-digit My Number cards with embedded IC chips in 2016. The cards serve as official identification and can be used for various services, including taxes, health insurance, and facial recognition. However, the adoption of My Number card remains slow and incomplete, about 25% of Japanese citizens still have not obtained the cards.

                To accelerate adoption, the Japanese government and e-payment services providers have implemented a series of cashless initiatives. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2019, the Point Reward Program launched in Japan offered a 2% to 5% rebate for cashless purchases at participating stores and online shopping sites. The program also subsidized retailers by covering the costs of adopting payment terminals and part of the transaction fees.
            </p>

            <p>
                The program ended in June 2020, with a 9%-12% higher number of card users at participating businesses, according to the Center for Advanced Research in Finance at University of Tokyo.

                Popular mobile payment services, such as PayPay, Line Pay and Rakuten Pay, offer loyalty points and cashback rewards to consumers.

                While the younger generations have embraced digital payment systems, drawn by the convenience of point accumulation and built-in spending tracking, older demographics remain strongly attached to cash transactions. 
            </p>

            <p>
               ‚ÄúI don't think the government will push to one direction,‚Äù  Naoyuki said.  ‚ÄúI think there remain two separate groups: those who prefer to use cash and those who prefer to use cards. However, those who like to use cards will become bigger and bigger,‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
                The existing digital payment providers are looking at how to expand their market share. PayPay, for instance,  is integrating its banking (PayPay Bank), securities (PayPay Securities), and credit card (PayPay Card) services into its main app, offering a comprehensive financial services ecosystem that goes beyond simple payments.
            </p>

            <p>
               Meanwhile, Japan is now developing its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) initiative. Since 2023, the Bank of Japan has been conducting a three-year pilot program for digital yen, collaborating with the country‚Äôs three megabanks and regional financial institutions. The CBCD seeks to combine cash‚Äôs univeral accessibility with digital convenience while maintaining monetary stability.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, Naoyuki warned about the vulnerability in cashless systems. He added that natural disasters or cyber attacks can pose a significant risk to cashless payment systems.

            </p>

            <p>
               ‚ÄúIn case of incidents, any alternative way to pay by not using these (e-payment) cards but also some other methods should be developed much more,‚Äù he said.
